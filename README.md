# ML_Library

The purpose of this repository is to create ML models from scratch.

I chose to create this project to better sharpen my understanding behind the math and optimization techniques behind common statistical learning models.  I hope to achieve a more intimate familiarity with the models and how/when they should be used in real world applications.
